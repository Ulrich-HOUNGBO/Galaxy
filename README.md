Problem solved

A source of entertainment for young people who like to have fun.
It is also a hobby for adults in their down time.
Unresolved problem

This solution does not solve some of our everyday problems, namely managing our daily tasks.

The users

This project could be of interest to everyone as we all have to entertain ourselves at some point.

Infrastructure

Create a git repository to manage and version the project.
Create a branch for each member of the group, make changes to each branch of the project, then make a pull request, review the code and validate the pull request. Then merge the two branches onto the main branch and delete them afterwards. 

For the deployment strategy, create a playstore and appstore account and publish the application on these different platforms so that anyone can access it. 

Existing Solutions

There are several types of games on different platforms of the same type as ours, such as games in the chrome and edge browsers, but the particularity of our application is that it can be deployed on all platforms without modifying the code.
